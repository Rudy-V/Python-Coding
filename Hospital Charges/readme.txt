Write a program to compute and display the charges for a patientâ€™s hospital stay. First the
program should ask if the patient was admitted as an in-patient or an out-patient. 

If the patient was an in-patient, the following data should be entered:
    The number of days spent in the hospital
    The daily rate
    Hospital medication charges
    Charges for hospital services (lab tests etc)

The program should ask for the following data if the patient was an out-patient:
    Hospital medication charges
    Charges for hospital services (lab tests etc)

Both functions should return the total charges.
